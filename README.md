# NNWind v0.01

An artificial neural network approach of modelling aerodynamic forces in long-span bridges.

# To Run
Simply execute the main function file, 'NNWind.m', without any arguments.

# Examples
Examples are included for buffeting and self-excited (heave and pitch) forces, trained analytically.
A numerical example is also included, as a model on how to input external data into the software.
The provided examples can be used to run the several analysis included in the software.
In addition, random displacement data and random gust profiles are provided for evaluation.
